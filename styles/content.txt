Company: VantaGrid Security

Tagline: Secure by design. Resilient by default.

Overview

VantaGrid Security is a future-focused cybersecurity studio that helps organizations stay safe in a world where AI-generated attacks, autonomous malware, and hyper-connected devices are normal. We combine threat research, practical engineering, and clear communication to reduce risk without slowing teams down.

Mission

Make advanced security simple, measurable, and built into everyday work.

Vision

A future where security feels invisible to users, obvious to defenders, and expensive for attackers.

Values

Clarity over fear: No panic language, just facts and priorities.

Privacy by default: Collect less, protect more.

Resilience over perfection: Assume incidents happen and design to recover fast.

Proof over promises: Every claim backed by tests, logs, and results.

What makes us different

We don’t sell “security vibes.” We ship security systems: hardened cloud setups, measurable controls, tested incident plans, and training that actually changes behavior.

Services
1) Threat Modeling and Risk Mapping

We map your systems, data flows, and real-world attacker paths. You get a risk register that’s understandable, ranked, and tied to fixes your team can complete.

Deliverables: architecture map, risk scores, prioritized fixes, executive summary.

2) Cloud and API Hardening

We lock down cloud accounts, containers, CI/CD pipelines, and APIs. We focus on identity, secrets, segmentation, logging, and safe defaults.

Deliverables: hardened configurations, IAM cleanup, secure CI templates, logging + alerting baseline.

3) Penetration Testing and Red Team Sprints

We simulate real attacks against web apps, mobile apps, and internal networks. Findings come with clear reproduction steps and fixes, plus a retest.

Deliverables: technical report, severity ratings, fix guidance, retest confirmation.

4) AI Security and Model Protection

We test AI features for data leakage, prompt injection, unsafe tool use, and training data risks. We also design guardrails and monitoring.

Deliverables: AI risk assessment, guardrail design, abuse tests, monitoring plan.

5) Incident Readiness and Response

We build an incident playbook that matches your tools and team. If something happens, we help contain, investigate, recover, and learn.

Deliverables: incident runbooks, tabletop exercise, response checklist, post-incident report template.

6) Security Training for Real Teams

Short, practical training that fits how people work: phishing resistance, passwordless habits, safe sharing, and what to do when something feels off.

Deliverables: workshops, quick guides, internal posters, monthly micro-drills.

Industries we work with

Fintech, healthcare, logistics, e-commerce, universities, and startups building AI features.

Process
Step 1: Discovery

We learn what matters: business goals, key assets, current tools, and constraints.

Step 2: Assessment

We test systems, review configs, and validate risks with evidence.

Step 3: Fix and Harden

We help your team implement changes fast, with minimal disruption.

Step 4: Prove and Monitor

We verify improvements, set alerts, and track progress over time.
